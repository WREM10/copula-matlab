# copula-matlab

A library for working with copula probability objects in MATLAB. This library extends and encapsulates existing copula support in MATLAB, by adding support for:

- d-dimensional Archimedean copulas
- Hierarchical Archimedean copulas
- Probabilistic copula classifier

## Prerequisities

To use the copula-matlab package, one needs to have _Statistics Toolbox_ and _Symbolic Toolbox_ installed.

## Examples

For examples on how to use the functions within the package please take a look example.m.

## Packages

The following packages can be found within the project:

- _archim_ - implementation of functions working with d-dimensional Archimedean copulas. Supports Clayton, Gumbel and Frank families.
- _hac_ - implementaions of functions for working with HACs. Supports Clayton, Gumbel and Frank families
- _copula_ - contains integration of existing and newly implemented functions under a single interface
